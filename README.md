## Description

This is a to-do-list application, created using ReactJs. 

## Usage
It allows users to add a task by clicking the add button, delete a task by clicking the delete button and also edit the task that they have already  by clicking the edit button. There is also a save button  that appears when a user is editing a task and it saves the changes made to the edited task when clicked. However, it prevents one from adding a "blank" task initially.
